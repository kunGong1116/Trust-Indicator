## 1. 📜 Introduction & Project Sign-off

This document marks the official handover of the Trust Indicators project from the S1 2025 development team. The project aimed to develop an Australian-themed image gallery website that helps users better understand and assess the authenticity of uploaded images by displaying their metadata and providing visual cues. This website is an open-source project, allowing users to upload their own images while adhering to Creative Commons (CC) licensing requirements. By collecting image metadata and displaying credibility signals, the website will assist users in identifying and discerning genuine images. Additionally, website members can contribute background information, such as photographer statements, to provide more contextual details. The project aims to offer consumers a reliable resource to enhance their ability to judge image authenticity and provides a platform for photographers and creators to showcase their work and offer additional information, thereby improving public understanding and awareness of images.

We sincerely thank the previous team for their valuable contributions to the project; their hard work and dedication have laid a solid foundation for us. For detailed information about the previous team's work, please refer to the materials provided at `https://github.com/Trust-Indicator/Trust-Indicator`.

## 9. 🔧 Maintenance & Support

### 9.1. 🗄️ Backup & Recovery Plan

A detailed **Backup & Recovery Plan (`Backlog&Revovery.pdf`)** is provided. Key aspects include:

* **Key Assets to Back Up:** Source Code (Flask application, Python scripts, HTML, CSS, JS), Database (SQLite file `MyDatabase.db` containing user info, image info, metadata, trust profiles), Configuration Files (deployment scripts, environment variables, Caddy configs), Project Documentation, and API Keys (instructions for retrieval/secure storage locations for Alibaba Cloud AIGC, ImgBB, email services).
* **Backup Strategy:**
    * **Source Code:** Primarily via Git/GitHub (`https://github.com/bridgeL/Trust-indicator`); periodic offline clones. Frequency: Git immediately after significant changes; Offline clones weekly or after major releases.
    * **Database:** Daily file copy of `instance/MyDatabase.db`, synchronized to secure remote location (e.g., using rsync or secure cloud storage with encryption). Retention: daily for 7-14 days, weekly for 4-8 weeks, monthly for 6-12 months, and one annual backup.
    * **Configuration Files:** Non-sensitive in Git; sensitive (e.g., actual API keys in `.env`) via secure password manager or encrypted archive.
    * **Project Documentation:** Via Git for Markdown documents; Cloud Storage/Shared Drive (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox) for binaries like PDFs.
* **Recovery Procedures:** Detailed steps for restoring Source Code (from Git/offline backup), Database (stop app, copy backup, verify, restart app), and Configuration Files (from Git/secure storage) are outlined.
* **Testing & Security:** Plan includes quarterly testing of recovery procedures, encryption of backups, access control, integrity checks, and off-site storage.
* **Responsible Parties:** The plan includes placeholder roles; **the next team should update this with actual responsible personnel**.

### 9.2. 🐛 Known Issues and Bugs

The project has undergone extensive testing and most core features have been validated (see `test details.pdf`). However, the following are known risks/areas for attention (identified in `24-S2 Trust indicators delivery plan.pdf` and `note.pdf`):

* **AIGC API Dependency:** Service unavailability or exceeding quotas for the Alibaba Cloud AIGC API may block detection features.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement local fallback or cache recent results to reduce API reliance. Fallback to simulated results is currently in place.
* **API Key Leakage:** Mishandling API keys could lead to security vulnerabilities or service suspension.
    * **Mitigation:** Store sensitive keys appropriately (e.g., `.env` file not in repo, use password manager) and rotate keys periodically. The client has been provided with keys securely.
* **Model Inaccuracy (Third-Party API):** Incorrect AI detection results from the third-party API may mislead users.
    * **Mitigation:** Display a disclaimer and provide confidence levels with explanations.
* **Frontend Refinement:** The frontend may have some minor UI/UX issues that require further testing and refinement.
* **Error Handling:** Some error handling and edge cases may need enhancement.

### 9.3. 🛠️ Maintenance Tips

(From `note.pdf`)
* **API Key Management:** The next team **must apply for their own API keys** (Alibaba Cloud, ImgBB, email services) and update them in the server's environment variables / `.env` file. Ensure continued secure handling.
* **Dependency Updates:** Regularly check libraries in `requirements.txt` for security updates or important version iterations and update as necessary.
* **Code Readability:** Continue maintaining and adding comments to the codebase to aid new members.
* **Frontend Performance:** For image-heavy pages like the gallery, consider optimizing further (e.g., advanced lazy loading, virtual lists).
* **Metadata Extensibility:** The `ExifExtractor` currently focuses on common EXIF tags. If support for more types of metadata (like XMP, IPTC) or more complex extraction logic is needed, this part can be extended.
* **Testing:** It is recommended to write unit tests for core modules (e.g., AIGC detection, metadata extraction, user authentication, database operations). Conduct integration tests for API interfaces.
* **Asynchronous Tasks:** For time-consuming operations, consider using task queues (e.g., Celery) to improve user experience and avoid request timeouts.

## 10. 🏁 Project Wrap-up & Future

* **💡 Suggested Improvements for Client and Next Team:** (Based on `note.pdf` and `Final checklist.md`)
    * Further enhance frontend performance for image galleries.
    * Expand metadata support to include XMP, IPTC, etc.
    * Develop a more comprehensive suite of automated unit and integration tests.
    * Implement asynchronous task handling for long-running processes.
    * Explore alternative or supplementary AIGC detection services or models.
    * Enhance the Trust Profile with more granular options.
* **📦 Jira PBI Export:**
    * The `TrustIndicator_Jira_Export.zip` (mentioned in the email, containing PBIs exported on 20/05/2025) contains all Product Backlog Items (requirements, tasks, and timeline) from Jira for archival purposes.
* **👥 Retrospective:** (Summary of successes, challenges, lessons learned)
    * The project successfully delivered all core functionalities as per the plan and passed all core feature tests. Challenges included reliance on external APIs and managing API key security. Lessons learned include the importance of robust fallback mechanisms and secure credential management from the outset. (The `Final checklist.md` mentions "Notes from final retrospective"; if available, these should be reviewed by the next team).
